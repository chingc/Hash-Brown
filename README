Description
-----------
Hash Brown is a commandline file hashing utility with convenient features.

Want to verify a file with a md5 digest quickly without creating a checklist?
hb md5 -i audio.flac 69afdf17b98ed394964f15ab497e12d2

Have a file with the checksum in the filename itself?
hb crc32 -e video_[B7BFA115].mkv

Checklists are also supported, but unlike more simplistic hashing utilities like
md5, sha1, et cetera, Hash Brown checklists may contain mixed types.  Hash Brown
also has a handy progress monitor that activates for sufficiently large files.




Installation
------------
Python 3.1 is required, so make sure it's installed and in your $PATH.  Then
follow these instructions to install Hash Brown.

1) Download and extract the source code to a directory of your choosing.
2) Make hb-cli.py executable.
       e.g. $ chmod 544 hb-cli.py
3) Create a soft link in your $PATH that points to hb-cli.py.
       e.g. $ ln -s <HASHBROWN_DIRECTORY>/hb-cli.py hb
4) Run Hash Brown.
       e.g. $ hb -h




Help (-h option)
----------------
Usage: hb -h | -v
       hb -c FILE(S)
       hb ALGORITHM -d FILE FILE [FILE FILE] [...]
       hb ALGORITHM -e FILE(S)
       hb ALGORITHM -i FILE DIGEST [FILE DIGEST] [...]
       hb ALGORITHM -s "hello, world!"

Algorithms:
    md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512
    adler32, crc32

Options:
    -h    this help screen
    -v    version information
    -c    checklist: verify the files given in a checklist
    -d    dupe: determine whether two files are identical
    -e    embedded: verify a file using the digest or checksum in its filename
    -i    inline: verify a file with a digest or checksum
    -s    string: hash a string of text

Notes:
    A checklist is an ordinary text file with lines like this:
    CRC32 (document.txt) = ad0c2001

    Checklists are allowed to have mixed types.  Example:
    CRC32 ("hello, world!") = 58988d13
    MD5 (audio.flac) = 69afdf17b98ed394964f15ab497e12d2
    SHA1 (video.mkv) = 1f09d30c707d53f3d16c530dd73d70a6ce7596a9

    Text can appear anywhere within the checklist.  Example:
    Top secret!  CRC32 (document.txt) = ad0c2001
    CRC32 ("hello, world!") = 58988d13  Strings are quoted!

    A blank line went by!
    MD5 (audio.mp3) = 69afdf17b98ed394964f15ab497e12d2
    SHA1 (video.mkv) = 1f09d30c707d53f3d16c530dd73d70a6ce7596a9
    That's all the files I want to check for now.
